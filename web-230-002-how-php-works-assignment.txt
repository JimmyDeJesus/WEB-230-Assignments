WEB-230 | How PHP Works – Server Side Scripting – Assignment
Explain the following:

Identify and explain the differences between server side and client side.
~Server side uses languages like PHP to communicate and program on the back end.
~Client side, is more front end where code languages like HTML. 


Identify and explain the differences between scripting and programming languages.
~I believe that the only difference is that scripting doesn't need the compiling step.
Some examples of scripting languages are JavaScript, PHP, and Python.


Explain what type of language PHP is.
~PHP is a scripting language that is used when working with servers.
 It does not need a compiler when working with the client. 


Explain the process of a request from client to server and back to client.
~The client would request a web address like www.google.com, the server would get that and pull data that will then 
go to the client where it would be compiled.  


Explain the differences between the different post types discussed in the video.
~There are GETS and POSTS. GETS can be cached and remain in the browser while POSTS do not.
There are Post-backs as well which helps files to return back to the same location in the server.
